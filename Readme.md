## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL Database
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/THILLAINATARAJAN-B/Attendance-System.git
   cd Attendance-System
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure PostgreSQL:
   - Create a database named `Attendance`
   - Update the database credentials in the code:
     ```python
     dbhost = 'localhost'
     dbname = 'Attendance'
     dbuser = 'your_username'
     dbpass = 'your_password'
     ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
